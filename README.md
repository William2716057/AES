This script performs encryption and decryption of a plaintext using advanced encryption standard (AES) in cipherblock chaining mode (CBC)

encrypt function generates an AES cipher in CBC mode.

decrypt function takes the ciphertext and key, extracts the initialisation vector, initialises AES cipher for decryption,
decrypts ciphertext and returns original message

Upon running script both the encrypted and decrypted messages should be displayed on the console
